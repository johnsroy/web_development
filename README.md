My HTML, CSS and JavaScript projects and games. A few personal coding exercises and samples which beginners can use to practice and get better at things. A few projects included here are as follows:
1) An online dating page form using HTML, CSS, JS (Part3.html)
2) A DOM color changing visualizer (colour_pattern.html)
3) Find the extra face - A Java Script game (matching_game.html)
4) Next, I am essentially trying to build an isomorphic app using all JavaScript dependent frameworks like Angular 2 and Node.js in the back end and finally I would use Mongo DB to finish a full stack web app. This is a personal project. I welcome any sort of changes,tips and updates as I go along.
